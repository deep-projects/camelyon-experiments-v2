    doc: "Path to SLIDEFILE in  OpenSlide tif format."
  mask:
    type: string?
    inputBinding:
      prefix: --mask
    doc: "PATH to mask file in CAMELYON XML format. If this is not given it will done a simple tissue segmentation with an otsu algorithm."

    doc: "PATH to a directory containing mask files. This PATH will be prepended to a relative --mask PATH, if --mask is specified. Otherwise --mask-dir is ignored."

    doc: "The pixel spacing that you want to use to get the HDF5-File. A lower number means a higher resolution. In CAMEYLON16 the first scanner have the following values: [0.0002439 0.00048781 0.00097561 0.00195122 0.00390244 0.00780488 0.0156098 0.0312195 0.062439 0.124878] and the second scanner: [0.00022727 0.00045454 0.00090909 0.00181818 0.00363636 0.00727273 0.0145455 0.0290909 0.0581818], If you want two layers at the highest resolution good values would be 0.0002439 and 0.00048781."
